This project covers the following algorithms:

a. Given an array of unsorted objects of some class (that implements hashCode and equals), 
move the distinct elements of the array to the front. The function behaves as follows. 
Let k be the number of distinct elements of A (k is not known). Find the k distinct elements of arr[], and move them to arr[0..k-1]. Return k. Use hashing to implement the algorithm in expected O(n) time. Signature: public static int findDistinct(T[] arr)

b. Finding the most frequently appearing element
i.e.Writing a function that takes as parameter an array of integers, and returns an integer that is most frequent in the array.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1. Implemented BinaryHeap
2. Implemented IndexedHeap and Prim's MST algorithm (MST.java)
3. Compared the running times of Prim1 (priority queue of edges)
   and Prim2 (indexed priority queue of vertices)
   
DESCRIPTION OF FILES
Driver.java  - Driver program.
Graph.java - class which represents a graph
Edge.java - class which represents an arc/edge of a graph
Vertex.java - class which represents a vertex/node in a graph
Helper.java - helper class for Graph functions 
BinaryHeap.java - Heap implementation which has base fucntions like percolateUp and percolateDown
IndexedHeap.java - Indexed Heap implementation
IntegerComparator - Comparator for verifying the Heapsort
PQ.java - Interface for Priority Queue
Index.java - Interface for Index
Shuffle.java - Utility for shuffling an array
   
INSTRUCTIONS TO EXECUTE THE FILES
1. Extract the archive and Copy all the source files to the required directory.
2. Please use below commands to compile the source files
> javac Driver.java
3. Execute the files using below commands
> java Driver [input.txt]
Here input.txt is an optional input file from which the graph is read
